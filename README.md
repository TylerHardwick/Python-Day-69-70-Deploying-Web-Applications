# Python Day 70 - Deploying web applications

Deploying web-applications using gunicorn and Heroku. Moving from SQLite to postgreSQL.

## Description


Project can be reached at [here](https://tyler-blog.onrender.com/).
Due to the removal of free tier on Heroku, this project has been adapted to be hosted using render.com.
I have implemented version control using git/github, which allows for the project to be redployed on render using lasted revisions.
