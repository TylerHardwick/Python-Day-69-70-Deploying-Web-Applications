# Python Day 70 - Deploying web applications

Deploying web-applications using gunicorn and Heroku. Moving from SQLite to postgreSQL.

## Description


Project can be reached [here](https://tyler-blog.onrender.com/).
Due to the removal of free tier on Heroku, I have adapted this project to be hosted using render.com.
I have implemented version control using git/github, which allows for the project to be redployed on render using lasted revisions.

OS is being used for environmental variables now that the blog is being hosted.
Flask specific .gitignore file was generate using [gitignore.io](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/).
